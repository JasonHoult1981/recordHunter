## What is Record Hunter
Record Hunter is an unmanaged package which includes demo components for searching Salesforce records with detail search conditions. Using the search component included in this package enables you to;
- Create a search box just by specifying the target object and fields in App Builder.
- Include fields on the parent object of the target object as a search condition.
- Search by keyword(SOSL) or/and condition(SOQL) with custom search logics(AND/OR).
- Set a fixed value as a default value, or retrieve the value from the context record and set it as default if the component is on a record detail page.
- Show the search result in a simple table on the same page or on new tab, or pass the result to another component.
- Sort, wrap texts, and jump to the record detail with the default result table.

This package includes another component specially designed to display the result. This component enables you to;
- Customize the columns to display on the table.
- Pick some records from the result and run flows of your choice on them.
